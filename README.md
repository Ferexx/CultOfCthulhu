COMP30880 project

We used Spring because creating a UI with HTML is far easier than doing it with something like Swing or AWT.

Staff/Project generation:
The program generates staff members from any sample .csv file. In our test cases we used the sample file provided on Brightspace. Staff projects are generated by randomly choosing a string of words from a static list stored in the program. It generates three projects per staff member, and outputs to a .txt file.

Student generation:
Student generation is done by taking a first name and a last name from two static files, and assigning a student id that starts at 0 and increases by 1 every time a new student is created. Stream is decided by randomly generating an integer between 0 and 10. If the number is less than 6, the student is assigned to CS. If the number is greater than or equal to 6, the student is assigned to DS.

Project preference generation:
Project preferences are generated on a per-student basis. What this means is that each time we create a student, we make a call to the project assignment function. This function uses the nextGaussian method of Random, with the values adjusted to suit our needs.
We found this page explaining how to do this: https://www.javamex.com/tutorials/random_numbers/gaussian_distribution_2.shtml


Sprint 2:

We added new classes for staff members and Projects. This required some significant restructuring of the parsing code to load the information into their relevant classes instead of storing it as lists of strings.

The work was tested using the csv uploaded in Sprint 1. A catch-all error page was added that redirected users to the beginning of the process in case something went wrong.
